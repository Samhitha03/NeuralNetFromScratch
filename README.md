# NeuralNetFromScratch
Three Layer Neural Net Using Only Numpy.  Builds on James Loyys' https://gist.github.com/jamesloyys/ff7a7bb1540384f709856f9cdcdee70d 2-layer (3 x 4 x 1 ) net from scratch by adding a third layer and a training rate. New net is (5 x 6 x 4 x 1). Shows how the process generalizes.
